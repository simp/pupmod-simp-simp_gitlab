  when upgrading from version 0.2.0.

* Wed Feb 28 2018 Liz Nemsick <lnemsick.simp@gmail.com> - 0.3.0
- Drop support for CentOS 6 in order to cleanly solve an intermittent
  problem in which the GitLab local user's authorized keys lock file
  could not be created.
- Modify sshd authorized keys file configuration so that the GitLab
  installer can manage the GitLab local user's authorized keys file
  and the directory in which it resides, independent of Puppet.
  Prior to this, both the GitLab installer (via Chef) and Puppet
  were simultaneously, but independently, managing the ownership,
  permissions, and selinux contexts of that authorized keys file
  and its directory.  Since the desired settings for the directory
  were different, intermittent problems such as the GitLab user
  not being able to create its authorized keys lock file arose.
