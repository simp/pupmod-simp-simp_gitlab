* Sat Dec 19 2020 Chris Tessmer <chris.tessmer@onyxpoint.com> - 0.6.1
- Maintenance update for module assets

* Thu Oct 29 2020 Liz Nemsick <lnemsick.simp@gmail.com> - 0.6.0-0
- Updates for GitLab application (12.3.0-13.x) and puppet/gitlab module 6.0.1
  - Removed:
    - Support for GitLab < 12.3.0.
    - TLSv1.1 from the default for `simp_gitlab::ssl_protocols`.
  - Changed:
    - Set the GitLab root password in a fashion that minimizes coupling of
      `simp_gitlab` with the internals of the `gitlab` module.
      - Set a throw-away password during initial GitLab package installation
        using GitLab configuration in /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb. Setting the
        password during initial install is the **only** way to ensure the
        password is not set by an external user. Otherwise, the first GitLab
        page that comes up is the page to reset the root password.
      - After GitLab initial configuration, set the real root password using
        a script that implements Gitlab-provided procedures for setting the
        password.
      - IMPORTANT: As a side effect of these changes, upon module upgrade,
        the password will be automatically set to the value of
        `simp_gitlab::gitlab_root_password`, unless the (empty) marker file
        `/etc/gitlab/.root_password_set` exists or the parameter
        `simp_gitlab::set_gitlab_root_password` is set to `false`.
        If you forget to disable this automation or just want to reset the
        GitLab root password, simply run
        `/usr/local/sbin/change_gitlab_root_password <new_password>` manually.
        You do not need to know the previous password to set the new password.
    - Use `chronyd` instead of `ntpd`, as GitLab itself uses `chronyd` and
      `chronyd` is required for EL8.
    - Use `gitlab` for managing packages again.
      - Change was only possible once the new mechanism for setting the GitLab
        root password was implemented.
    - Renamed the 'gitlab_monitor' key to 'gitlab_exporter' in the configuration
      hash.
      - Name change required for GitLab >= 12.3.0.
    - No longer set `gitlab::external_port`
      - The custom port is already appropriately configured via the
        `gitlab::external_url`.
      - 'external_port' is no longer a supported GitLab configuration key and
         causes `gitlab-ctl reconfigure` to fail.
    - `simp_gitlab` now fails to compile when the node is in FIPS mode,
      unless `simp_gitlab::allow_fips` (a new parameter) is set to `true`.
  - Added:
    - Support for EL8.
    - `simp_gitlab` parameters to enable setting the GitLab root password
      - `set_gitlab_root_password`
      - `gitlab_root_password`
      - `rails_console_load_timeout`
    - Script to change the GitLab root password,
      `/usr/local/sbin/change_gitlab_root_password`.
    - Disabling of Let's Encrypt usage in GitLab , by default.
      - The integration of SIMP PKI management with with Let's Encrypt has not
        yet been done.
      - To use Let's Encrypt, disable SIMP management of PKI by setting
        `simp_gitlab::pki` to `false` and then manage the certificates manually.
    - `svckill::ignore` rule for the GitLab service. Since the service
      is no longer managed by default by `gitlab::service`, this prevents
      the service from being inadvertently killed when it is unmanaged.
    - REFERENCE.md documentation.

  when upgrading from version 0.2.0.

* Wed Feb 28 2018 Liz Nemsick <lnemsick.simp@gmail.com> - 0.3.0
- Drop support for CentOS 6 in order to cleanly solve an intermittent
  problem in which the GitLab local user's authorized keys lock file
  could not be created.
- Modify sshd authorized keys file configuration so that the GitLab
  installer can manage the GitLab local user's authorized keys file
  and the directory in which it resides, independent of Puppet.
  Prior to this, both the GitLab installer (via Chef) and Puppet
  were simultaneously, but independently, managing the ownership,
  permissions, and selinux contexts of that authorized keys file
  and its directory.  Since the desired settings for the directory
  were different, intermittent problems such as the GitLab user
  not being able to create its authorized keys lock file arose.
